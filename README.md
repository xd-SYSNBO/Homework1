# A Little bit more about myself!
My name is _Oliver Sieyes_ and im _20_ years old

I love living in _Madrid_ and i have met some really cool friends here

I found coding with _R script_ to be quite challenging so im excited to see if i find python any easier, __Its looking like it so far!__

As i said before, i have 3 _hobbies_:
1. Skiing
2. Running
3. Listening to music

# Why am i studying Economics?

I really fell in love with _Economics_ in Highschool
There was something about learning about how our "world" functions beyond just day to day life, and i decided that Economics was just the thing for __ME__

## Side Note

I figured out what was wrong with my terminal and why none of the commands were working by just changing it to __BASH__ from __ZSH__
